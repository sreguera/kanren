An implementation of ÂµKanren for Go. Work in progress.

## TODO

* Stringize pairs as lists, maybe
* Infinite streams. next as interface{} and then type dispatch?
* Interleaving streams
* User level functionality (reify, run, ...)
* Can streams be implemented with channels?
* Use reflect and Ifz data type to support Go types?
* Comment functions and data types
